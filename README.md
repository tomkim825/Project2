# Anotoki (translation: that time)

## Description
Anotoki is a website application made to record and archive oral history. The application allows users to tell their story from a historical point in time from their perspective. For researchers and scholars, it will give them a resource to pull experiences from those who have lived them by providing perspectives to use as anecdotal evidence for their research.

## Purpose/Motivation
 The main focus of the app is to preserve that unique perspective of oral history in a database. One of the major benefits of oral history for researchers and scholars is itâ€™s ability to bring life to the voices and experiences of individuals, many whom might have otherwise have been forgotten by history. Our app will help build a bridge to connect others with similar experiences and help to connect researchers to those maybe forgotten oral history.
